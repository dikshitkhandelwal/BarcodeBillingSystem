# BarcodeBillingSystem
 
 
Introduction


Developed the software for a self checkout kiosk without the use of conditionals. It is with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) where the user/customer will input the numeric barcode for each item they want to purchase and the items will be displayed along with their prices. Items can have sales tax, discounts, bottle deposits, and more so your software will have some work to do to compute the final price of each item.
